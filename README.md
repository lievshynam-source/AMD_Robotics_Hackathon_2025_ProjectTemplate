# AMD_Robotics_Hackathon_2025_[Project Name]
*Submission is for the task you did in Mission 2, since Mission 1 was a "hello world" task for every team.*

## Team Information

**Team:** *Your team number, name of your team, and members*

**Summary:** *A brief description of your work*


## Judging Criteria

### 1. Mission 2 Description (10 points)
- *Real world application of your mission*

### 2. Creativity (30 points)
- *What is novel or unique in your approach?*
- *Innovation in design, methodology, or application*

### 3. Technical implementations (20 points)
- *Teleoperation / Dataset capture*
- *Training*
- *Inference*

### 4. Ease of use (10 points)
- *How generalizable is your implementation across tasks or environments?*
- *Flexibility and adaptability of the solution*
- *Types of commands or interfaces needed to control the robot*


## Code submission

This is the directory tree of this repo, you need to fill in the `mission` directory with your submission details.

```terminal
AMD_Robotics_Hackathon_2025_ProjectTemplate-main/
├── README.md
└── mission
    ├── code
    │   └── <code and script>
    └── wandb
        └── <latest run directory copied from wandb of your training job>
```


The `latest-run` is generated by wandb for your training job. Please copy it into the wandb sub directory of you Hackathon Repo.

The whole dir of `latest-run` will look like below:

```terminal
$ tree outputs/train/smolvla_so101_2cube_30k_steps/wandb/
outputs/train/smolvla_so101_2cube_30k_steps/wandb/

**NOTES**

1. The `latest-run` is the soft link, please make sure to copy the real target directory it linked with all sub dirs and files.
2. Only provide (upload) the wandb of your last success pre-trained model for the Mission.
